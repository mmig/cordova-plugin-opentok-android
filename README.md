cordova-plugin-opentok-android
==============================

Cordova plugin for OpenTok integration on the Android platform (Cordova 2.x; OpenTok Android SDK 2.0beta1).

See /demo/README.md for instructions on building / running the demo app.

Expands on the OpenTok Cordova plugin for iOS (i.e. uses same JavaScript source; expands on it).

This implementation was tested / used in combination with the OpenTok jQuery plugin (as reference, also contained in the demo folder).

NOTE: You have to ensure, that opened subscriber/publisher views get closed when page is changed / the HTML-elements
      are removed; you should explicitly close the session or un-subscribe / un-publish in this case.


WARINING:
This implementation is currently outdated (see version information above).
